# WinonaNG

###   Angular implementation of the Winona UI Component Library.

This project is part of the Winona UI suite, aimed at providing seamless UI components for Angular developers. Our goal is to ensure that these components work flawlessly on Windows, but they are designed to be cross-platform compatible as well.

**WinonaNG** is named to reflect its heritage as part of the Winona UI family. The core idea is that if our UI components run smoothly on Windows, they can run anywhere. This focus addresses the often-overlooked compatibility issues that Windows users face when contributing to open-source projects that are typically optimized for macOS.

Our mission is to provide a reliable, Windows-friendly UI component library for Angular, reducing friction for Windows users in the development community. We aim to make it easier for you to build great Angular applications without worrying about platform-specific issues.
